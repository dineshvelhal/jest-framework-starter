# jest-framework-starter
(As per the Jest website) Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

I have created this project as a starting point for those who want to use Jest for functional test automation. 

If you are planning to use Jest in your testing work, this project will surely give you a good head-start.

# So, what is jest-framework-starter?
This is a Test Automation Framework with a lot of important features already built-in.
## It's preconfigured
It comes with a jest config file that has a lot of settings already configured. This means, you can use it as-is or  customize it further as per your needs. see the central jest config file [here](https://github.com/dineshvelhal/jest-framework-starter/blob/master/jest.config.js).

## Global Setup & Teardown scripts
Under the [testconfig](https://github.com/dineshvelhal/jest-framework-starter/tree/master/testconfig) folder, there are `setup` and `teardown` scripts. They run only once for entire set of tests that get executed. You may add global-level setup and teardown code here. To begin with, these scripts only print the colorful messages on the console.
